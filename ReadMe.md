- any switches off ts
- ts is all about types. We can be very strict or very loose on types.
- ts is designed to help developer (in its own way)
- with ts we can avoid weird typechecking in js, commenting(Types are not rendered in a browser so we save some file size)
- ts is smart enough to infer types from logic, but it does not mean that dev meant to be this way. So we need to tell ts exactly what we mean.
